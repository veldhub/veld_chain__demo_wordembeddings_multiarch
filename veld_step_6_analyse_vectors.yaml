    description: "Reads in the trained word vectors from their pkl serializations and tests them for
      plausability on a few selected words which should show intuitive close or distant relations to
      each other. This chain does not inherit from a code veld but is defined entirely within its
      containing chain repository since its code and data are highly context-specific. 

      After reproducing the entire previous sequences yourself and execution of the notebook, feel
      free to save the notebook and compare the resulting differences with `git diff
      ./code/analyse_vectors/notebooks/analyse_vectors.ipynb`, where the reproduced vector
      similarities will have only slight differences to the record of previously trained ones. This
      difference is due to randomization within the training, but should be small enough to indicate
      approximate reproduction."
